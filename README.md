I'm a Data Science practitioner and computer programmer with an avid interest in Natural Language Processing and traditional Machine Learning. As a core programmer, I love taking challenges and love being part of the solution.

I have hands on experience in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, deployment on IaaS like AWS. Solid Programming expertise in Python, Object Oriented analysis/methodologies.

Technologies that I have experience on :

- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Python
- T-SQL
- Docker
- Flask
- Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JS

When in times of leisure, I like to read books in the genre of mystery thriller, pyschology, and self-help. I am usually found pursuing a MooC or reading a book to gain knowledge about the stuff that I don't know or with the intention of deep diving into stuff that I already now.
